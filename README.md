# SimpleAH
This is a modified version of a really old version of Aux. Which was itself based on Auctionator. I preferred the old version of Aux because it was simple. Then I added a lot of new features, while maintaining its simplicity.  

I renamed it SimpleAH so that it wouldn't interfere with the new Aux. I can't guarantee there are no bugs, but I tested it as much as I could.  

This picture shows the buy tab. All searches are saved as buttons on the left(Quick Buy). There is a checkbox next to each search to keep that search at the top. You can shift-click to highlight multiples items. You can also buy from the sell tab.

Note: The addon does not split stacks when posting. When posting multiples, it only posts the same stack size. This isn't a problem if you're selling full stacks or items that don't stack. If you're wanting to spam the AH with single stacks, you'll have to split them manually(or use lazypig shift-right click). I thought about adding this, but I didn't want to aid people spamming the AH.
