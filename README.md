# SimpleAH
This is a modified version of a really old version of Aux. Which was itself based on Auctionator. I preferred the old version of Aux because it was simple. Then I added a lot of new features, while maintaining its simplicity.  
I renamed it SimpleAH so that it wouldn't interfere with the new Aux. I can't guarantee there are no bugs, but I tested it as much as I could.
